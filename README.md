# SAS_Projects

This repository is a showcase of my SAS programming skills, featuring a collection of SAS macros and code examples for various statistical analysis projects.

## Current Projects

### 1. Linear Regression Macro

This project demonstrates a SAS macro for automating linear regression analysis.

**Macro Features:**

* **Automated Variable Selection:** The macro includes stepwise selection to identify significant predictors.
* **Output Generation:** It generates detailed output including parameter estimates, fit statistics, and diagnostic plots.
* **Customization:** The macro allows for easy customization of input datasets, dependent and independent variables, and model selection criteria, while handling highly correlated predictors.

**Files:**
* `linear_regression_macro.sas`:  The SAS macro code.


**Usage:**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open `example_usage.sas` in SAS.
3.  Modify the input dataset and variable names as needed.
4.  Run the code to execute the macro and generate the output.

## Future Projects

* **Survival Analysis:**  This project will feature SAS macros for survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.
* **Longitudinal Data Analysis:** This project will showcase SAS code for analyzing longitudinal data using techniques like mixed models and generalized estimating equations (GEEs).

**Stay tuned for updates!**
